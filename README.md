<main>
  <p>My name is Fazli. I used to be a sale and then I discovered programming :boom:.</p>
  </p>Quit my job and started learning Python on my own (webscrapping, web with Django, a bit of data with :panda_face:)</p>
  <p>Started a course in may 2022 to learn Web Development with OpenClassrooms. Ended with a certification and new competencies : Javascript / React / NodeJS (ExpressJS) / Sass</p>

  <p>Appart from that, I enjoy good music :musical_note:, mangas :ok_hand: and discussing with people :sun_with_face:.</p>

  <p>I'm currently looking for a junior position as a :computer: Web Developer (may it be Front or Back)</p>
